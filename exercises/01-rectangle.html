    <h1>01 - Rectangle Exclusions</h1>
    <p>Exclusions allow you to define areas for text to wrap around. As one example, you can define a rectangle which text will avoid. In order to layout text this way, you need to calculate the intersection between each line and the rectangle. A line is represented by the minimum and maximum y value for the line. A rectangle is represented by an x, y, width, and height. An intersection is represented by the minimum and maximum x value that is inside both the line and rectangle bounds.</p>

    <p><a href="../demos/rectangle.html">fullsize sample</a></p>
    <p>Given a rectangle and a line, find the minimum and maximum x values that are inside both the rectangle and the line.</p>
    <div class="page-break"></div>
<code><pre>
/**
 * Return the minimum and maximum x values of a
 * rectangle within a line's bounds.
 * Return null if there is no intersection.
 * @param {{
 *     x: Number,
 *     y: Number,
 *     width: Number,
 *     height: Number
 * }} rectangle
 * @param {{
 *     yMin: Number,
 *     yMax: Number
 * }} line
 * @returns {{ xMin: Number, xMax: Number }|null}
